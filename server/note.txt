              2. update existing something => POST/product

# GET : when we want to see data

# PUT : update existing something
# PATCH : update some feature of existing something
# DELETE : removing an item

CRUD : CREAT, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

# for modularize in nodeJs there are 2 way - 1. commonJs (require) 2. es6 (import/export)
# for es6 we add "type": "module" in package.json 
# for es6 when we import then use this way => import envConfig from "./config/envConfig.js"; // need to append the .js extension

# we dont share the .env file, add it into .gitignore file
# why .env?
    if we want to run the project somewhere else then the ALLOWED_ORIGIN/Database url will be different
    so we create .env file where we store secret info. 

# we will create .env.example for understanding the environment variable
# how we use the environment variable in out application?
    we should install a library named: .env (npm i dotenv)
